3.7.3 Requirements Display
ID: Debug_89
The display software shall implement a log message filter mechanism to only transfer messages with a loglevel 
smaller or equal the "pass-through loglevel" defined for the display context.
ID: Debug_114
The display software shall set the pass-through log level to the default value ERROR on startup.
ID: Debug_115
The display software shall adapt the pass-through loglevel on reception of SET_DLT_LOGLEVEL message.
ID: Debug_90
The concrete set of messages for each loglevel, their content and their frequency shall be discussed with and approved by BMW.
ID: Debug_91
Message content must be decodable by BMW so that the content is human readable. A fibex file shall be provided 
so that message content can be decoded by DLT viewer.
ID: Debug_92
Communication shall be abstracted in a way that display specific functionality is implemented on display hardware.
ID: Debug_93
The implementation of this high-level protocol on display side shall be part of the supplier's delivery and is in his responsibility.
ID: Debug_131
Provide concept outlining how to implement event tracing as described in chapter 2 and 3
The concept shall indicate which events will be captured, how long the events might be captured and how the captured data will be analyzed on developer system.
ID: Debug_132
Provide a proposal how to implement debugging during startup, shutdown and before software controlled reset of the display as described in chapter 2.
ID: Debug_133
Provide concept on how to implement triggering of system behavior in critical system states as described in chapter 2.
The proposal shall indicate which system states will be triggerable and which additional protocol messages are required.
